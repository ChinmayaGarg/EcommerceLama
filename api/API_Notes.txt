Firstly, we will create our first user.
We can login or register user which can be done in 2 ways:
1. Inside our user API [Not Recommended] [Not best practice because login process is a different word and 
   to create more secure applications we should create a separate route like "auth.js"]
2. Creating separate API (auth.js) [Recommended]

Auth.js: Route for login and register.
