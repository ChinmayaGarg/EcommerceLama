Initial Steps to start with back-end development from scratch:

Step 1: Created index.js file
Step 2: Initiate Node.js application by running "npm init -y" in terminal (inside the folder api)
        This will create a package.json file.
        Package.json will have application name, version name, name of main file.
        Here we will install dependencies, libraries and will write scripts.
